# Private Blockchain Application

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of a Blockchain platform.
Concepts like:
    - Block
    - Blockchain
    - Wallet
    - Blockchain Identity
    - Proof of Existance

These components in the Blockchain Framework are implemented in javascript. In this project, I used a boilerplate code with a REST Api already setup to expose some of the functionalities implemented in my private blockchain.

## What problem will you solve implementing this private Blockchain application?

This project is a test of concept on how a Blockchain application can be implemented in any company.
Here, a scenario of astronomy fans who spend most of their free time on searching stars in the sky. This application will help them to register stars making sure the application knows who is the owner of each star.

### The process

1. The application will create a Genesis Block when we run the application.
2. The user will request the application to send a message to be signed using a Wallet and in this way verify the ownership over the wallet address. The message format will be: `<WALLET_ADRESS>:${new Date().getTime().toString().slice(0,-3)}:starRegistry`;
3. Once the user have the message the user can use a Wallet to sign the message.
4. The user will try to submit the Star object for that it will submit: `wallet address`, `message`, `signature` and the `star` object with the star information.
    The Start information will be formed in this format:
    ```json
        "star": {
            "dec": "68Â° 52' 56.9",
            "ra": "16h 29m 1.0s",
            "story": "Testing the story 4"
		}
    ```
5. The application will verify if the time elapsed from the request ownership (the time is contained in the message) and the time when you submit the star is less than 5 minutes.
6. If everything is okay the star information will be stored in the block and added to the `chain`
7. The application will allow us to retrieve the Star objects belong to an owner (wallet address). 


## Tools/Technologies

- This application was created using Node.js and Javascript programming language. The architecture used ES6 classes
because it helps to organize the code and facilitate the maintnance of the code.
- The company suggest to use Visual Studio Code as an IDE to write my code because it is easier to debug.
- Some of the libraries or npm modules used are:
    - "bitcoinjs-lib": "^4.0.3",
    - "bitcoinjs-message": "^2.0.0",
    - "body-parser": "^1.18.3",
    - "crypto-js": "^3.1.9-1",
    - "express": "^4.16.4",
    - "hex2ascii": "0.0.3",
    - "morgan": "^1.9.1"
    Libraries were installed using the Node Package Manager command:  `npm install <npm_module_name>`

Libraries purpose:

1. `bitcoinjs-lib` and `bitcoinjs-message`. Those libraries help to verify the wallet address ownership, it is used to verify the signature.
2. `express` The REST Api created for the purpose of this project is created using Express.js framework.
3. `body-parser` this library is used as middleware module for Express and helps to read the json data submitted in a POST request.
4. `crypto-js` This module contains some of the most important cryotographic methods and helps to create the block hash.
5. `hex2ascii` This library will helps to **decode** the data saved in the body of a Block.

## Understanding the boilerplate code

The Boilerplate code is a simple architecture for a Blockchain application, it includes a REST APIs application to expose the  Blockchain application methods to the client applications or users.

1. `app.js` file. It contains the configuration and initialization of the REST Api, the team who provide this boilerplate code suggest do not change this code because it is already tested and works as expected.
2. `BlockchainController.js` file. It contains the routes of the REST Api. Those are the methods that expose the urls needed to call when making a request to the application.
3. `src` folder. In here, I added the main two classes I needed to create my Blockchain application, I created a `block.js` file and a `blockchain.js` file that contain the `Block` and `BlockChain` classes.

### Starting with the boilerplate code:

First, I downloaded the boilerplate code.

Then, I installed all the libraries and module dependencies, to do that: open a terminal and run the command `npm install`

**( Remember to be able to work on this project you will need to have installed in your computer Node.js and npm )**

At this point we are ready to run our project for first time, use the command: `node app.js`

You can check in your terminal the the Express application is listening in the PORT 8000

## Tasks to satisfy employer requirements:

1. `block.js` file. In the `Block` class we are going to implement the method:
    `validate()`. 
    /**
     *  The `validate()` method will validate if the block has been tampered or not.
     *  Been tampered means that someone from outside the application tried to change
     *  values in the block data as a consecuence the hash of the block should be different.
     *  Steps:
     *  1. Return a new promise to allow the method be called asynchronous.
     *  2. Save the in auxiliary variable the current hash of the block (`this` represent the block object)
     *  3. Recalculate the hash of the entire block (Use SHA256 from crypto-js library)
     *  4. Compare if the auxiliary hash value is different from the calculated one.
     *  5. Resolve true or false depending if it is valid or not.
     *  Note: to access the class values inside a Promise code you need to create an auxiliary value `let self = this;`
     */
2. `block.js` file. In the `Block` class the method:
    `getBData()` is implemented.
    /**
     *  Auxiliary Method to return the block body (decoding the data)
     *  Steps:
     *  
     *  1. Use hex2ascii module to decode the data
     *  2. Because data is a javascript object use JSON.parse(string) to get the Javascript Object
     *  3. Resolve with the data and make sure that you don't need to return the data for the `genesis block` 
     *     or Reject with an error.
     */
3. `blockchain.js` file. In the `Blockchain` class the method:
    `_addBlock(block)` is implemented.
    /**
     * _addBlock(block) will store a block in the chain
     * @param {*} block 
     * The method will return a Promise that will resolve with the block added
     * or reject if an error happen during the execution.
     * You will need to check for the height to assign the `previousBlockHash`,
     * assign the `timestamp` and the correct `height`...At the end you need to 
     * create the `block hash` and push the block into the chain array. Don't for get 
     * to update the `this.height`
     * Note: the symbol `_` in the method name indicates in the javascript convention 
     * that this method is a private method. 
     */
4. `blockchain.js` file. In the `Blockchain` class the method:
    `requestMessageOwnershipVerification(address)` is implemented.
    /**
     * The requestMessageOwnershipVerification(address) method
     * will allow you  to request a message that you will use to
     * sign it with your Bitcoin Wallet (Electrum or Bitcoin Core)
     * This is the first step before submit your Block.
     * The method return a Promise that will resolve with the message to be signed
     * @param {*} address 
     */
5. `blockchain.js` file. In the `Blockchain` class the method:
    `submitStar(address, message, signature, star)` is implemented.
    /**
     * The submitStar(address, message, signature, star) method
     * will allow users to register a new Block with the star object
     * into the chain. This method will resolve with the Block added or
     * reject with an error.
     * Algorithm steps:
     * 1. Get the time from the message sent as a parameter example: `parseInt(message.split(':')[1])`
     * 2. Get the current time: `let currentTime = parseInt(new Date().getTime().toString().slice(0, -3));`
     * 3. Check if the time elapsed is less than 5 minutes
     * 4. Veify the message with wallet address and signature: `bitcoinMessage.verify(message, address, signature)`
     * 5. Create the block and add it to the chain
     * 6. Resolve with the block added.
     * @param {*} address 
     * @param {*} message 
     * @param {*} signature 
     * @param {*} star 
     */
6. `blockchain.js` file. In the `Blockchain` class the method:
    `getBlockByHash(hash)` is implemented.
    /**
     * This method will return a Promise that will resolve with the Block
     *  with the hash passed as a parameter.
     * Search on the chain array for the block that has the hash.
     * @param {*} hash 
     */
7. `blockchain.js` file. In the `Blockchain` class the method:
    `getStarsByWalletAddress (address)` is implemented.
    /**
     * This method will return a Promise that will resolve with an array of Stars objects existing in the chain 
     * and are belongs to the owner with the wallet address passed as parameter.
     * 
     * @param {*} address 
     */
8. `blockchain.js` file. In the `Blockchain` class the method:
    `validateChain()` is implemented.
    /**
     * This method will return a Promise that will resolve with the list of errors when validating the chain.
     * Steps to validate:
     * 1. You should validate each block using `validateBlock`
     * 2. Each Block should check the with the previousBlockHash
     */

## How to test the application functionalities?

To test the application, it is recommended to use POSTMAN, this tool will help make the requests to the API.

1. Run the application using the command `node app.js`
You should see in your terminal a message indicating that the server is listening in port 8000:
> Server Listening for port: 8000

2. To make sure the application is working fine and it creates the Genesis Block you can use POSTMAN to request the Genesis block:
    ![Request: http://localhost:8000/block/0 ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/April/5ca360cc_request-genesis/request-genesis.png)
3. Make your first request of ownership sending your wallet address:
    ![Request: http://localhost:8000/requestValidation ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/April/5ca36182_request-ownership/request-ownership.png)
4. Sign the message with your Wallet:
    ![Use the Wallet to sign a message](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/April/5ca36182_request-ownership/request-ownership.png)
5. Submit your Star
     ![Request: http://localhost:8000/submitstar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/April/5ca365d3_signing-message/signing-message.png)
6. Retrieve Stars owned by you
    ![Request: http://localhost:8000/blocks/<WALLET_ADDRESS>](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/April/5ca362b9_retrieve-stars/retrieve-stars.png)
